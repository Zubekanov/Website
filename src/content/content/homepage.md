## About This Website

The GitHub repository for this project is available at [github.com/Zubekanov/Website](https://github.com/Zubekanov/Website).

The site is self-hosted on an 8 GB Raspberry Pi 5, with DNS handled by Cloudflare. Thereâ€™s a placeholder Cloudflare Worker in `src/offline/` intended to serve a static fallback page at [offline.zubekanov.com](https://offline.zubekanov.com) when the main site goes down, but is not currently functional.

You can monitor CPU, memory and uptime on the built-in **Server Stats** page at `/server`, or by clicking the uptime icon at the top of the page.

Under the hood, the backend is Python/Flask with a PostgreSQL database for user data and service management. All static assets (images, icons, CSS) are served directly from the Pi.

The frontend uses plain HTML and CSS, prioritising minimal client-side load and robust server-side resource handling.

User accounts and email verification are supported. They may be more useful in the future, but currently are just proof of concept for database management.
