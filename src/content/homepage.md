## About This Website

The Github repository for this project is available at [github.com/Zubekanov/Website](https://github.com/Zubekanov/Website). <br>

The website is self-hosted with an 8gb Raspberry Pi 5, with DNS resolution provided by Cloudflare. This project includes a lightweight Cloudflare Worker that serves a static HTML fallback page whenever the main site is offline. The source code for the Worker lives in [`src/offline/`](https://github.com/Zubekanov/Website/tree/main/src/offline), and the fallback page is always available at [offline.zubekanov.com](https://offline.zubekanov.com), even when the main site is up.

The backend is written in Python using Flask and integrates a PostgreSQL database for storing user data and managing services. Static resources such as images, icons, and CSS files are served directly from the Raspberry Pi. <br>

The frontend utilises basic HTML and CSS, with the focus of the project on managing resources server-side and minimising client-side load.
