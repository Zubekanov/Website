# PopuGame Rules

1. Players alternate turns placing one token on an empty square.
2. You cannot place a token on a square currently claimed by the opponent.
3. If your move forms a continuous line of at least 3 of your tokens (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), a claim is triggered.
4. The triggered token line is removed, then claim territory extends along that line in both directions until blocked by board edge or an opponent token.
5. Claims may overwrite opponent claims, but does not remove opponent tokens.
6. Score equals the number of currently claimed squares.
7. The game ends at the turn limit. Highest score wins; equal scores are a draw.

I played this game in the POPUCOM minigames section, and I couldn't find any real game it was based off of when searching afterwards.
